### Hullo! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Citybook Services LLC as a full stack developer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning. Right now it's Node.js and Express, but who knows what tomorrow may bring?
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. Get in touch and maybe we'll build something cool together!
